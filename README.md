# Discord-Weather-Bot
A discord bot that utilizes the WeatherAPI to tell the weather and forecast of a given location

This discord bot utilizes two API functions from WeatherAPI which are the weather and forecast API. The user of this bot will be able to type the 
command "!weather <city>" or "!forecast <city>" which will tell the weather or forecast of the given city. In the weather command, the weather command 
will say the temperature, humidity, precipitation level, gust speed, and wind speed of the given city. In the forecast function, the function will tell 
the forecast of the given city for the next 7 days. The forecast command will detail the city's weather conditions, and the estimated minimum and maximum 
temperature. There is also a "!help" command to list all available commands within this bot.
